                        <h1>What is transliteration?</h1>
						<h2>Defining something that has historically resisted definition</h2>
						<p>Though its merits and practice have been debated since Ball State and the early days of professional interpreting, there is not a good consensus about the definition, process, and successful outcome or product of transliteration. In order to become better practitioners of transliteration, we need to 1) better understand what it is and what it is not and 2) discuss differences and similarities in the process, product, skills and abilities, and application of transliterating work.</p>
						<p>Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>How has transliteration been defined since 1964? Why doesn’t transliteration have a consistent definition?</li>
							<li>Using the concept of ‘user stories,’ create definitions of how transliteration can be used by different audiences.</li>
							<li>What does the published literature have to say about descriptions/definitions of signed-language transliteration?</li>
							<li>What are the main themes of notable researchers</li>
						</ul>

								<h4>Feedback: A Conversation about ‘The Work’ Between Learners and Colleagues (Witter-Merithew)</h4>
								<p>This article contains an unpublished article (2001) by Anna Witter-Merithew, Director of the Mid-America Regional Interpreter Education Center (MARIE) and a former assistant director of the DoIT Center (now Department of American Sign Language and Interpreting Studies) at the University of Northern Colorado, regarding how we have historically spoken about interpreting work and posits a new paradigm of discussion.</p>

								<h4>Transliteration Equivalency Rubric</h4>
								<p>This is a transliteration performance rubric based on twelve skill categories. Your pre-assessment assignment will be rated on these skills. Let’s use this rubric as part of our discussion.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card col _50">
								<h4>EIPA Skills Rating Rubric</h4>
								<p>This is EIPA’s rating form used to measure equivalency and accuracy on EIPA performance assessements. Let’s also use this rubric as part of our discussion.</p>

						<h3>Additional readings</h3>
							<h4>Non-evaluative feedback language (Colonomos)</h4>
							<p>Colonomos’ “yellow sheet.” Simple yet essential recontexting of feedback language we use with interpreter colleagues. To be used in class discussions and interpretive work processing. Live it. Love it. Learn it. (Don’t download this unless you lose the yellow copy handed out in class.)</p>
							<h4>How to Turn Disagreement Into a Team Strength</h4>
							<p>Again, written from the perspective of product designers, this article reminds is that disagreement is not inherently bad, if we’re both working towards the same end. “You are not your idea, and if you identify too closely with your ideas, you will take offense when they are challenged.” Consider how disagreeing with your team member can actually be productive in the work we produce.</p>
